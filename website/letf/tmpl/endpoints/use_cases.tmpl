                                                    Let's imagine a scenario where an investor owns 100 shares of {{template "etf" "SPY"}} and thinks that SPY will rise in value.

                                                <h1 class="card-title">Consolidation</h1>
                                                Consolidation of positions is a strategy that can be used to simplify
                                                the
                                                management of a portfolio.
                                                It involves combining multiple investments into one, reducing the
                                                complexity of
                                                the portfolio and allowing it to be more easily managed.
                                                For example, if an investor holds a variety of ETFs, stocks, and other
                                                investments, they can consolidate those positions into a single ETF such
                                                as SPY,
                                                which contains all the same investments.
                                                This allows the investor to manage their portfolio with less effort,
                                                while still
                                                maintaining exposure to the same assets.

                                                For example, an investor who holds {{ template "stock" "AMZN" }}
                                                , {{ template "stock" "META" }},
                                                {{ template "stock" "MSFT" }}, and {{template "stock" "AAPL" }} can
                                                consolidate
                                                those positions into the {{template "etf" "XLK"}} ETF, which contains
                                                all of
                                                those stocks with 50+ percent exposure

                                                Stocks and ETFs are a popular way to invest in the stock market,
                                                allowing
                                                investors to diversify their investments and benefit from potential
                                                returns. One
                                                way to categorize stocks is through themefication.
                                                This means that stocks can be grouped according to their
                                                characteristics, such
                                                as sector, size, or style.
                                                For example, {{template "stock" "SNDL" }}, {{template "stock" "CRON" }}
                                                and {{template "stock" "TLRY" }} are all in the cannabis industry, while
                                                {{template "etf" "POTX" }} is an ETF that tracks the performance of the
                                                cannabis
                                                sector. By themefying stocks, investors can identify and invest in
                                                companies
                                                that have similar characteristics and could potentially provide higher
                                                returns.
                                                Additionally, themefication can also help investors identify potential
                                                risks
                                                associated with a particular sector or industry. Overall, themefication
                                                can be a
                                                useful tool
